# Lead_score_case_study
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, 
many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.

The company markets its courses on several websites, search engines, and even social media sometimes. 
Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses, fill out a form for the course, 
or watch some videos. When these people fill out a form with their email address or phone number, they 
are classified as leads. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads 
are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process,
some of the leads get converted into successful sales, while most of the leads do not. The typical lead to
successful sale conversion rate at X education is around 30%.

 

Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead-to-sale conversion rate is very poor. For example, 
if they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted into successful sales.
To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also
known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate would 
go up as the sales team would now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather 
than making calls to everyone. A typical lead conversion process can be represented using the following funnel.
